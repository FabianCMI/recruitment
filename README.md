My first android app
# Made as a recruitment test for infomaniak

This App consists in an ITunes catalog browser

It features : 
  - Itunes Api calls with retrofit 
  - JSON parsing into custom object with Moshi 
  - Scrolling screen thanks to a recycler view
  - Menu and custom toolbar
  - dialog fragment with custom layout and interface
  - Storage in sharedPreferences to keep the last api call and call it directly on app opening
  - Implicit Intent to redirect to the ITunes Store

As I never had programmed native android app or used kotlin before, it was a real challenge but a also a great learning experience to make this app in only one week.

Features which still could be implemented : more precise filters, history of research, stats page (users love stats on their search), translation...
